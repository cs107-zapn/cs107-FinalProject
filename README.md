# Broader Impact

Zapn-AD creates computationally efficient methods for finding derivatives and optimizing functions. While many stakeholders in the science, engineering, and business field can benefit from less costly and accurate optimization, the user assumes some uncertainty when implementing Zapn-AD. We designed our software to be as precise and efficient as possible, and it is critical to discuss the further reaching impacts of our work both positive or negative.

First, if the user is not familiar with differentiation or optimizations fundamental concepts, they undertake a fair amount in uncertainty when using Zapn-AD. To reduce such uncertainty, we provide full documentation of our software package. However, the implementation and interpretation of results could be skewed based on the user's prior knowledge. While we purposely designed our software to be intuitive, we recommend that the user fully assess their requisite knowledge and use case before reporting results. 

Blind faith in any software results could lead to an erroneous implementation. While we do not anticipate incorrect or faulty results, any result applied in practice carries significant consequences. For example, consider the use of an optimizer to improve some engineering workflow which involves high resource cost. Erroneous implementation or interpretation could potentially stall such workflow causing a loss in human resources, time, or money. Therefore, we always suggest taking a step back to evaluate the situation and doing a logic check before enacting any change in the real-world based on our package's results.

# Software Inclusivity

Zapn-AD intends to provide automatic differentiation and optimization fairly for all people in the programming community. As beneficiaries of free, open-sources software, we invite anyone to use and contribute to our package. Diversity of opinion, background, and experience is welcomed and encouraged. We evaluate pull requests and additions to the package in an unbiased fashion. We recognize that our software documentation and code structure favor English speakers, and hope that Machine Translation services can ease this barrier.
