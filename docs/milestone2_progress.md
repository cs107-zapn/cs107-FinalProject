# Milestone 2b Check Point

### Group Member Progress Since Milestone 1

- Arno: Arno has been reading more deeply about forward mode AD and has been familiarizing himself with pytest.
  
- Nico: Nico has outlined the skeleton of what needs to be implemented for Milestone 2. He has also learned more about the cosine function.
  
- Priya: Priya has been re-familiarizing herself with pytest and has been brainstorming edge cases.
  
- Zheng: Zheng has been learning about back propagation for feedforward neural networks.
  
### Milestone 2 Task Orginization 

- Arno: Arno will work on writing test code (primarily in conjunction with Priya) and writing the forward mode (in conjunction with Zheng). He will contribute to the docs for AD, primarily.

- Nico: Nico will implement the module that overload the elementary functions and will work on writing a large portion of the Docs, in conjunction with the other group members. 
  
- Priya: Priya will write the majority of the test code, working with everyone writing the individual modules. She will also work on the docs, primarily with respect to code coverage.
  
- Zheng: Zheng will implement dual numbers data structure for the one-dimensional case for forward mode. Zheng will contribute to the docs for AD with Arno.
