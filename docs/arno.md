# Introduction: 
The main goal is to develop a software library where we can use computational methods to compute derivatives that would otherwise be costly or unstable to evaluate. Namely, we will implement automatic differentation (AD). We will implement both the forward mode and also the reverse mode. AD methods are much more efficient than  numerical and estimation techniques.  

# Licensing:
We have decided to choose the GNU General Public License. We chose this license because it is a copyleft license, which will allow users to use and even modify our code to their preferences, with the guarantee that such a freedom won't be taken away. Copyleft, as stated on the GNU GPL website, says that "anyone who redistributes the software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and change it."
