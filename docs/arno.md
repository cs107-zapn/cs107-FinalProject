#Introduction: 
The main goal is to develop a software library where we can use computational methods to compute derivatives that would otherwise be costly or unstable to evaluate. Namely, we will implement automatic differentation (AD). We will implement both the forward mode and also the reverse mode. AD methods are much more efficient than  numerical and estimation techniques.
